# Summary:
Macchiato is an object-oriented programming project that implements a simple programming language with object-oriented features. The project includes classes for creating and executing programs written in the Macchiato language, along with a debugger for step-by-step execution, variable inspection, and runtime analysis.

The Macchiato language offers functionalities such as arithmetic expressions, loops, conditional statements, and basic instructions for printing and modifying variables. The project was developed incrementally, with version 1.0 focused on building the debugger, version 2.0 adding procedures and unit tests, and subsequent versions introducing builder patterns for easier program creation.

The main goal of the project is to provide a convenient and extensible environment for programming in the Macchiato language, combining object-oriented principles with language-specific features.

## Macchiato Syntax:

**Program**: Consists of a single program block that encapsulates all instructions.

**Block**: Used to group related instructions; variables are declared at the block's beginning.

**Variables**: Support integer storage and are declared only at the block's beginning.

**Expressions**: Allow arithmetic operations, including variables and constant values.

**Control Flow**: Provides conditional statements (if) and loops (for) to control program execution.

**Procedures**: Support function-like structures with parameters.

**Scope**: Follows block-level scoping rules.

**Dynamic Binding**: Utilizes dynamic binding for variable resolution during runtime.

**Input/Output**: Supports basic input/output operations, with the "print" statement for output and methods for input.

## Sample Programs
The "Main" class contains sample programs demonstrating various features of the Macchiato language. Users can explore and run these programs to gain a better understanding of the language and its capabilities.
